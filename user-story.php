		<h1>User Story</h1>
		<p>My user has a really hard time choosing the right car, so in order to make the
		process easier he wants to make a list of cars he likes. On cargurus they give you
		the option to make a compilation of "liked" cars by offering a red heart 'like'
		feature that then organizes the cars in one area all together.</p>
